### Technology
FPE is based on [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), an open-source library for interactive maps. Various additional Leaflet plugins and javascript libraries are used, details of which can be found in the source code. Maps are based on [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM). Many thanks for those who contribute and make their work available for others to build upon.
